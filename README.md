# ARCHITEC
Math 153 Final Project of Group Mayad
A Zendo-inspired puzzle game made with Python using the Pygame module in 2 weeks.


## Credits
- Code, graphics, and sound effects by Group Mayad
- Music by Totomori (https://www.youtube.com/@tottomori)
    - Songs from Sproutpop and Shoreline mistward albums


## Requirements
- pygame-ce module (note that this is the community edition)
	- see the quick start section of https://pyga.me/docs/ for reference
- check for new updates at the github repository: https://github.com/plutonium-dreams/structure_game11


## Controls
- WASD - up down left right
- J - cycle through the colors
- K - cycle through the shapes
- SPACE - place piece
- ENTER - verify structure
- ESCAPE - go back to main menu
- TAB or click green button to put in guess


## How to Play
At the start of the game, you will see two structures on different grids, the left side (the one with the black circle) will follow a certain secret rule which you will try to guess. The right (the one with the white circle) will follow a false rule, which will give you a clue on what combinations not to try. 

At the lower center of the game, you are given a 3x3 grid where you will be placing you will be making your own structure in hopes to try and get the secret rule, at the right side of the grid you will see what shape and color you have selected. Once you have made a structure, click enter and the game will tell you if your structure follows the secret rule by lighting the guess button green if it does. 

If the guess button is green, you will be able to click it or press tab for the guess menu to open. Input the amount of the shape and color that you have guessed to be the secret rule. Note that the positions or relationships between shapes do not matter as the secret rule is only based on only one shape’s amount, color, and type. 

If you guessed correctly you will add one point to the amount of wins you have on that run and be given a new pair of structures to guess a new secret rule. 

If timer mode is on, you will only have a limited amount of time to guess, and after every win your time to guess will decrease. 

Note that the only way to save your high score in the leaderboards will be through timer mode. Good luck! :))
